## Understanding AWS Services

Now that I have covered what cloud computing is and other things related to it, at this stage an individual can choose a cloud provider and study their services.

Something interesting is that if you choose AWS Cloud and study it, you can still use the same knowledge for Google Cloud and other cloud providers. Some words may just change, but you don’t have to worry about that because the core concept remains the same.

Let us look at it this way: imagine you are working for a Toyota car company as a mechanical engineer. As time goes on, you stop working for them and start working for Honda. You are still a mechanical engineer, right? The brake, accelerator, and clutch are still in the same places.
What may slightly differ are the guidelines and processes, but you are still a mechanical engineer.

In the same way, if you study AWS Cloud, you can still use that knowledge in other cloud provider environments.

I am preparing for the AWS Cloud Practitioner exam, so everything I will be talking about will be based on AWS Cloud. Some words may sound a little strange at first, and you may wonder, “What is that?” Don’t worry—we will understand what all these things are and how they work as we move forward.

In this section, I will be talking about one of the AWS services called **Amazon EC2 (Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud)**. But you may be wondering, why did I have to study all this about cloud?

Imagine you are working in a pharmacy as a pharmacist. It is your job to know about different medicines and know which one to give to a customer based on their complaint.

Now, I want you to look at the AWS services that I will be discussing as medicines you must know. You need to understand how they work, when to use them, and how to explain their benefits to your CEO or anyone in the company who does not understand cloud computing.

That is what the AWS Cloud Practitioner exam is about, being familiar with these services. This does not make you a professional yet, but it gives you access to the knowledge (objectives) and the management console (theory) to understand how things work.



## What Is Amazon EC2 (Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud)?

In simple terms, Amazon EC2 is the process of accessing the compute resources you need—such as CPU, memory, storage, networking, and more-over the internet to run whatever you want.

In other words, it means setting up a virtual (server) compute over the internet for your needs.
