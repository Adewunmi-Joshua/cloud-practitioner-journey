## Serverless Computing

In this section, I will be talking about what serverless computing is about. Not only that, but also managed services, unmanaged services, and fully managed services like Lambda, containers, Amazon EKS, ECS, and so on.

So let start with serverless computing: this makes you deploy code or run your application without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. It is not that the computing does not have servers, that is why you should not worry. No, it is just that AWS will maintain that aspect for you while you focus on other aspects. So now let talk about the managed, unmanaged, and fully managed services.

### Managed Service
This means AWS is going to take care of most of the work for you, like setup, updates, scaling, security patches, and so on. Although you may still deal with configuration depending on the service, it comes with less control.

### Unmanaged Service
This means AWS is going to give you the infrastructure components for you to deal with, from customer data, firewall configuration, data encryption, maintenance, networking, and so on, which gives full control but comes with more aspects to maintain.

### Fully Managed Service
This means AWS takes care of every heavy aspect for you, meaning you don’t have to worry about servers or underlying infrastructure while you focus on development.
