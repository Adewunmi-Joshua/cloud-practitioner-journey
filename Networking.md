Networking is one of the very important parts in the cloud learning journey and an interesting part also.

So let dive in and talk about VPC (Virtual Private Cloud), Subnet, public subnet, and private subnet.

What is cloud networking: Cloud networking is the process of using cloud-based resources to connect employees, organisations, people, and applications, removing the stress of setting up your own infrastructure and maintaining it.

What is VPC (Virtual Private Cloud): This allows you to have a private section in the cloud virtually and stay isolated from other customers to launch your resources.

Let look at it like this: imagine you are living with your parents but in a different block, meaning that you are sharing the same gate entrance for going in and out, but have two houses in the compound and you live in one, which is your own private section that you control. Same as VPC, it is your private place that you own in the cloud virtually to launch your resources.

Now let talk about subnet: This allows you to arrange your resources into public and private sections and is used to isolate and share resources publicly.

Let go back to your block (house) in the compound. You will agree with me that if a visitor arrives, the first place they are allowed to sit or that is public for everybody is the parlour, not your room, because that place contains your personal belongings and you need some privacy, although you can give some trusted people access into your room.

I want you to look at subnet like this: it allows you to group resources to public, like website frontend that everybody can access and interact with, like the parlour where the visitor can sit, change the TV channel, and feel relaxed. When the resources are grouped in the private subnet, it is not for the public to interact with or access, like database, storage, logging tools, backend server, and so on, just like the way your room is not allowed for any visitor to enter, because it is your private and restricted section.

But remember, you can give access to trusted people. The same thing applies to private subnet: you can give access to what the subnet is holding to the developers and engineers that are permitted to work on it.
