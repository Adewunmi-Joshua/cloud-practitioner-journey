# cloud practitioner journey

This repository documents my personal understanding and learning journey in cloud
computing, specifically **AWS Cloud**. I am preparing for the **AWS Cloud
Practitioner exam**, with a goal of moving into the **security aspect of the cloud**.

Everything here is written base on my own knowledge as I learn. The purpose of this repository
is not just exam preparation, but to clearly explain cloud concepts in a simple and
practical way. I believe learning is better when you can explain what you know.

This repository is also open for learning, corrections, and improvements, so other
people can read, learn from it, and grow alongside me.
