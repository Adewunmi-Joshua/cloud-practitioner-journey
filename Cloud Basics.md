Imagine you want a computer for your website, games, or whatever. Buying all the parts like the motherboard, CPU, storage, RAM, power supply, and cooling, then setting it up and keeping it running – that's a huge pain and costs a ton.

Cloud computing lets you skip all that. Instead of building your own setup, you just rent space on the cloud. A few clicks, and you're good to go. The cool part is it all happens online, and you only pay for what you use.

Basically, cloud computing means you're renting other people's computers over the internet instead of owning and taking care of your own.
## Benefits of Cloud Computing

### 1. Pay Only for What You Use
Cloud allows you to pay only for the resources you are using.

You may be asking, *how does this work?*

Let’s look at this example: imagine you want to read a particular book, but it is very
expensive to buy. Instead, there is an online platform that allows you to rent the book
for $3 whenever you need it, with no extra charges. You get access to the book, pay
your $3, and that’s all.

Cloud works in a similar way. You are renting a computer (server) over the internet.
If you use it for 5 hours in a day, you are only charged for those 5 hours—nothing more.

### 2. Reduced Cost and Stress
Cloud makes things easier and cheaper.

If you want to host a website, analyze data, deploy applications, train AI/ML models,
or run a database using your own computer (server), you will need to buy hardware,
pay for electricity, cooling, internet, and also maintain everything. This is costly
and stressful.

With cloud computing, you don’t have to worry about all these. The cloud provider
handles the hardware and maintenance for you, while you focus on what you want to build.

 ## what is cloud provider?
 
A cloud provider is simply a large businesses that owns and manages big data centers
across the world.

These providers offer computing resources such as servers, storage, and networking
over the internet, so individuals and companies do not have to build and manage their
own infrastructure.

Think of it like this: **sweets** are a product, and the sweet industry is an industry
on its own. To produce sweets, you need factories, machines, raw materials, and
distribution systems. Companies like **Nestlé**, **Hhershey**, and **Mars Inc.** are
called sweet providers because they invest in producing and delivering sweets.

In the same way, **cloud computing is an industry or system on its own**. Cloud
providers are the companies that invest in building massive data centers and delivering
cloud services to users.

Examples of major cloud providers include **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**,
**Microsoft Azure**, and **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**.

### 3. Very Fast to Set Up
Everything in the cloud happens over the internet.

With just a few clicks, you can set up servers, storage, or applications from the cloud
console and see them go live within minutes.  
What is a **console**? I will get to that very soon.

### 4. Going Global
What does *going global* mean?

Imagine you build a website and host it on your own computer (server) in Nigeria.
The website will be live, but it may be slow or hard to access for users in other
parts of the world.

With cloud computing, you can deploy your website in different regions and zones
around the world. This makes your website easier and faster to access globally.
I will also explain what **regions** and **zones** mean very soon.

### 5. Easy Scalability (No Worrying)
Remember the book rental example: if you need more copies for your friends, the
library can easily provide them.

Cloud works the same way. If you need more computers (servers), storage, or power,
you can get them instantly. You don’t have to worry about running out of resources.

## Types of Cloud (Deployment Models)

### 1. Cloud-Based Deployment (Public Cloud)
This is when a company or business makes use of the cloud to host its website or
deploy its applications. All computing resources such as servers, storage, and
networking are provided by a cloud provider and accessed over the internet.

In this case, the company does not own the physical servers. Everything runs on the
cloud, and the company simply pays for what it uses.

---

### 2. On-Premises (Private Cloud)
On-premises is when an organization decides to set up and manage its own computers
(servers) within its own company or data center instead of using the cloud.

Some companies choose this approach because of regulations, security requirements,
or full control over their data and systems. In this setup, the organization is
responsible for buying, managing, and maintaining the infrastructure.

---

### 3. Hybrid Cloud
Hybrid cloud is a combination of cloud-based deployment and on-premises infrastructure.

Think of it this way: you work for a company that allows you to work from home
and also come into the office two days a week. You are using both environments at the
same time.

In the same way, hybrid cloud means an organization uses both the cloud and its own
on-premises servers together. Some workloads run in the cloud, while others stay
inside the company’s own infrastructure.

## Cloud Service Models

### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
This is a system where you can rent cloud resources over the internet, such as
storage, databases, and networking, instead of buying your own hardware and
maintaining it.

In other words, you are making use of cloud infrastructure instead of setting up
your own servers.

---

### Platform as a Service (PaaS)
This is when you don’t have to worry about the infrastructure layer at all. You only
focus on the platform or application you are building.

The cloud provider handles the infrastructure for you, while you concentrate on
development.

---

### Software as a Service (SaaS)
This is when you don’t have to worry about how the software was developed or how
the infrastructure works. Your only responsibility is to learn how to use the
software.

Let me use this example: most people use Zoom. When you sign in, do you worry about
how the platform was built, the storage capacity, or the servers running it?
Of course not. Your focus is simply on using it for your meetings.
That is exactly how Software as a Service works.

## Regions, Zones, and Management Console

These words were mentioned earlier. This section gives a simple explanation and they will be explained in more detail in upcoming documents.


## Region
A **region** is a geographical area (usually a country or part of the world) where cloud data centers are located.


## Availability Zones AZ
**Zones** are specific spots within a region where those data centers live. Every region has a few of these zones, and they team up to make sure things stay up and running and to keep things fast.

**Example:**

Let's say Nigeria is a region.

Inside Nigeria, Lagos might have several zones spot, maybe like:

- Victoria Island  (data center 1 is here)
- Ikoyi   (data center 2 is here)
- Lekki   (data center 3 is here)

All these zones work together so that if one zone has an issue, others can still deliver resources without interruption.


# Management Console
The **management console** is a tool used to access and manage cloud resources.

It is usually a web based interface where you log in and use clicks to create, configure, and control cloud services.
